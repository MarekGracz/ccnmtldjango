Django quickstart template with CCNMTL settings. 

To use, have Paster installed, then install ccnmtldjango into your
system with:

  % sudo python setup.py install

and then quickstart projects like so:

  % paster create -t ccnmtldjango

and it'll be all set up for containment and CCNMTL configs.
