0.14.0 (2011-08-15)
===================

* updated to djangowind 0.10.0, which does LDAP queries directly and
  drops dependency on cdap.ccnmtl.columbia.edu

0.13.1 (2011-05-24)
===================

* made easy_install bootstrap step actually work if eggs are present,
  instead of exploding
* made easy_install bootstrap step pass silently if `requirements/eggs`
  directory doesn't exist, instead of exploding

0.13.0 (2011-04-27)
===================

* switched to psycopg 2.4, with a tarball that works around psycopg2's
  mx.DateTime dependency bug
  (http://psycopg.lighthouseapp.com/projects/62710-psycopg/tickets/53)
* removed the egenix-mx-base egg
* since mx was the only default egg, it now only runs the easy_install
  bootstrap step when eggs are actually present

0.12.0 (2011-04-14)
===================

* Fully pinned bootstrap process, including virtualenv, setuptools and pip
* Upgraded to virtualenv post-1.6, pip 1.0

0.11.5 (2011-03-25)
===================

* Switched order of dependencies django-paging and django-templatetag-sugar
  so pip knows not to go to the network to install the latter.  Sigh.

0.11.4 (2011-03-25)
===================

* Updated bootstrap.py to force pip to break loudly if it tries to
  download any requirements from the internet, i.e. if any dependencies,
  direct or nested, are not pinned to source distributions included
  in the requirements directory
* Added django-sentry's nested dependencies

0.11.3 (2011-03-01)
===================

* removed django-survey
* added django-sentry and configured for CCNMTL sentry (minus the
  SENTRY_KEY, which needs to be kept secret)
* added django-munin

0.11.2 (2010-07-14)
===================

* Removed django-tinymce 

0.11.1 (2010-06-22)

0.11.0 (2010-06-18)
===================

* Updated from Django 1.0.2 to 1.2.1
* Added distributions of psycopg2, PIL and egenix-mx-base
* No longer hardcode use of Py2.5
* Fix bug which causes "ValueError: too many values to unpack" on django startup

0.10.0 (2010-02-24)
===================

* Switched from MochiKit to jQuery
* tablesort.js now uses images served from django-friendly directories (/site_media/ instead of /static/)
* tablesort.js now has extendable field/column types
* Updated admin media location in apache conf to expect a pip-installed Django instead of easy_installed Django
* Include django-staticmedia

0.9.x and below
===============

If anyone feels like going through the history and adding these changes, go for it, but it's probably not worthwhile.
